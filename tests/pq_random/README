This directory contains programs to generate a random sequence of priority 
queue calls, for input to the DIMACS Priority Queue Driver.  Files are 

pq.c :  	 a priority queue implemented as a heap
pq.h : 		 type definitions, prototypes, MAXNAMES, MAXITEMS
dimacs_input.c : the parsing routines
PQ_Random.c : 	 the random priority queue generator
test.in     :    sample input
test.out    :    sample output

To compile: 
     gcc pq.c dimacs_input.c PQ_Random.c -o pqrandom

pqrandom takes its input from stdin, one command per line.  Commands are:

 init  X             [number of initial inserts]
 reps  Y             [number of repetitions] 
 with  xxx           [xxx is one of: ins dcr fmn dmn] 
 seed  N             [random seed]
 prio  P             [max priority] 
 comm  A comment line.
 
Only the _init_ and _reps_ lines are required.  There may be multiple _with_
lines.  The program first generates X random priority queue insertions. 
Then it performs Y repetitions, generating operations specified by _with_
lines.  The operations are performed in the sequence [ins dcr fmn dmn] 
during each iteration.  Every item is given a unique name at insert time.

The _prio_ command sets the max integer priority P (default 100).  For 
random inserts, the priorities are uniformly from the integer range 1..P,  
with a decimal timestamp added to ensure unique priorites (forming a real 
priority).   For decrease-key operations, an item is chosen at random, and 
a new priority is selected uniformly from the integer range [C .. R], where C 
is the current priority and R is the priority of the root (and the timestamp 
is attached). 

For example, this produces 30 random insertions followed by 30 delete-mins: 
  init 30
  reps 30
  with dmn

This produces 40 random insertions, followed by 200 reps of 
insert/decrease-key/delete-min: 
   init 40
   reps 200
   with ins
   with dcr
   with dmn
